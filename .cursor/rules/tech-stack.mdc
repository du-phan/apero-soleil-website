# Tech Stack Overview for "Terrasse au Soleil"

This project uses a modern, high-performance web stack optimized for geospatial visualization and beautiful UI. All contributors and code LLMs should be aware of the following core technologies:

## Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15 (App Router)**: Main frontend framework, using React Server Components for performance and modularity.
- **React**: Component-based UI development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling, with custom design tokens.
- **Supabase (with PostGIS)**: Cloud database and spatial backend for terrace and sunshine data.
- **MapLibre GL JS**: Open-source map rendering library for interactive maps.
- **Vercel**: Deployment platform, using Edge Functions for location-based optimizations.

## Key Libraries & Utilities
- `framer-motion`: Advanced UI and map effect animations (e.g., Solar Flare effect).
- `swr`: Data fetching, caching, and revalidation on the client.
- `csv-parser`: For local CSV data parsing during development.
- `supercluster`: Efficient clustering of map markers.
- `@vercel/analytics`: Simple, privacy-focused analytics.
- `date-fns`: Date and time utilities.
- `tailwind-merge`: Utility for merging Tailwind classes conditionally.

## Project Structure
- See [DEV_PLAN.md](mdc:DEV_PLAN.md) for a detailed directory and file structure.

## Data Handling
- Sunshine and terrace data is stored in Supabase (PostGIS) for production, and in CSV for development/testing.
- GeoJSON is used for map data interchange.

## Map & Geospatial
- MapLibre GL JS is used for rendering, with custom map styles in `public/map-styles/`.
- Supercluster is used for marker clustering.
- Mapbox Geocoding API is used for search functionality.

## Deployment & Performance
- Vercel is used for deployment, with Edge Functions for fast, location-aware responses.
- Next.js dynamic imports and code splitting are used for performance.
