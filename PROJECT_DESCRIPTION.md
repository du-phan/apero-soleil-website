# üåû BUILD ASSIGNMENT: "Terrasse au Soleil" - Discover Sun-Drenched Paris Terraces

Create a visually captivating yet intuitive web application that helps people find sun-soaked bar terraces in Paris. The experience should deliver an immediate "wow factor" while remaining focused on a single, essential user need.

## üìã CORE MISSION

Help users answer one crucial question with delight and precision:
**"Where can I find a sunny terrace in Paris right now (or at my chosen time)?"**

## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL FOUNDATION

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) with React Server Components for optimal performance
- **Data Storage**: Supabase with PostGIS spatial extensions
- **Map Visualization**: MapLibre GL with custom styling
- **Deployment**: Vercel with Edge Functions for location-based optimizations
- **Analytics**: Simple, privacy-focused page view tracking only

## üìä DATA STRUCTURE

The application will use a pre-computed sunlight dataset (~700k rows) stored on Supabase with these fields:

- `terrace_id` (unique identifier, also serves as address)
- `terrace_lat`, `terrace_lon` (geographical coordinates)
- `date` (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `time_slot` (HH:MM in 30-minute increments, ranging from 09:00-21:00)
- `is_sunlit` (boolean indicating sun presence)
- Additional metadata fields for calculations (sun altitude, azimuth, etc.)

For testing and development purposes, use the sample geojson dataset in `/src/data/`

## üé® DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### 1. Visual Clarity with Emotional Impact

- Use a **golden ratio-based layout** with the map as the central element
- Implement a **sunshine-inspired color palette**:
  - Primary: Warm amber (#F9A825) for sunlit areas
  - Secondary: Cool slate blue (#607D8B) for shaded areas
  - Accent: Vibrant coral (#FF5252) for interactive elements
- Apply **consistent visual hierarchy** with 8px spacing increments
- Ensure **accessibility compliance** with WCAG AA standards (contrast, focus states)

### 2. Focused User Experience for MVP

- Prioritize two main user journeys:
  - Searching for terraces near a specific location (search-first approach)
  - Browsing sunny terraces directly on the map (browse-first approach)
- Ensure each interaction provides immediate visual feedback
- Design the core search/browse experience to work within 3 clicks
- Maintain a simple, intuitive interface that requires no instructions

### 3. Performance-First Approach

- Achieve **Lighthouse performance score >95**
- Target **<1.5s Time to Interactive** on mobile devices
- Implement **spatial indexing** for lightning-fast queries
- Use **dynamic import boundaries** for code splitting
- Ensure smooth animations even on mid-tier mobile devices

    - Fallback to copy-to-clipboard with visual confirmation
  - Engaging, auto-generated share text:
    - Time-aware messaging (e.g., "I found this sun-soaked terrace for this evening in Paris! ‚òÄÔ∏è")
    - Terrace-specific details when applicable (e.g., "Le Perchoir Marais gets sunshine until 19:30 today!")
    - Branded hashtag (#TerrasseAuSoleil) for tracking
  - OpenGraph metadata for rich link previews:
    - Dynamic map thumbnail showing the terrace location
    - Custom title and description based on context
    - Sunshine status indicator in preview image

## ‚ú® THE "WOW MOMENT": Solar Flare Effect

The standout visual feature that creates an instant emotional connection while remaining technically feasible:

### The Solar Flare Effect

A dynamic, responsive visual system that intuitively communicates sunshine patterns across Paris:

- **Radial Gradient Propagation**:

  - When users change time settings or initially load the map, sunny terraces emit expanding radial gradients in warm amber
  - The propagation follows the actual sun angle for that time of day, matching real-world light direction
  - Implementation via CSS radial gradients and animations with SVG masks to control effect shape

- **Sun-Angle Light Rays**:

  - Sunny terraces display subtle, animated light rays extending from their position
  - Rays are angled and sized based on the actual sun position and altitude for the selected time
  - Longer, softer rays appear at sunset/sunrise periods
  - Implementation via simple SVG paths with CSS animations

- **Interactive Light Response**:

  - As users hover near sunny terraces, the light effect subtly intensifies (like clouds parting)
  - Effect responds to cursor/finger position, creating a sense of "discovering" sunshine
  - Implementation via mouse/touch position tracking with CSS variable updates

- **Time-Shift Transition**:
  - When changing times, a subtle "sweep" of light moves across the map in the direction of the sun's movement
  - Terraces changing from sunny to shaded (or vice versa) emit a brief golden flash
  - Implementation via CSS transitions with timing based on geographic position

This effect provides immediate feedback on sunshine patterns while creating an emotional connection to the experience of seeking sunshine in Paris. It's technically feasible through standard web technologies (SVG, CSS animations) without requiring WebGL, making it broadly compatible while still delivering visual impact.
